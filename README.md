# Exploring optimization and regularization methods in Federated Learning
Project for the CS-439 course (Optimization for Machine Learning).

## Plan of action
- [ ] Get familiar with [Flower](https://github.com/adap/flower) 

- [ ] Centralized setting

  - [ ] Implement PyTorch data loading
  
  - [ ] Implement PyTorch training
  
  - [ ] Implement PyTorch testing

- [ ] Distributed setting

  - [ ] Implement Flower Client 

  - [ ] Write data partitionning methods
  
  - [ ] Distribute data amongst clients
  
- [ ] Write plotting functions

- [ ] Play around with different methods
